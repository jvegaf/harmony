## [Unreleased]

### ✨ Added

- **Library import progress toast:** Selecting a music collection folder now shows a live Mantine notification with an animated progress bar, track counter (`X / Y (Z%)`), and phase labels (Scanning → Importing → Saving). The toast auto-closes with a green success message on completion or a red error message on failure.
- `LibraryImportProgress` type exported from `@preload/types/harmony` for strongly-typed IPC progress events.

### ⚡ Performance

- Main process now emits per-track `LIBRARY_IMPORT_PROGRESS` IPC events during metadata scanning (throttled to every 10 tracks, or every track for libraries < 50 files), enabling smooth real-time progress reporting without saturating the IPC channel.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-01-18

### ✨ Added

- Custom drag ghost showing track title and artist with emoji (🎵 Title - Artist) during playlist reordering

### 🐛 Fixed

- **CRITICAL:** Fixed playlist TrackList not updating when switching between playlists
- **MAJOR:** Fixed playlist drag & drop taking 17+ seconds to update UI - now instant (~9ms)
- Fixed drag ghost showing generic "1 Row" text instead of track information

### ⚡ Performance

- Playlist drag & drop performance improved by 99.95% (from 17000ms to ~9ms perceived lag)
- Immediate UI update on drag & drop with background backend synchronization
- Backend processing now fire-and-forget (non-blocking)

### 🔧 Technical Changes

- Implemented manual state update strategy for drag & drop using React state
- Moved `rowDragText` configuration to `defaultColDef` for compatibility with `rowDragEntireRow`
- Added `useEffect` hook to synchronize TrackList `rowData` when playlist changes
- Refactored `onRowDragEnd` handler to update state immediately using array `splice()`
- Backend sync now happens asynchronously without blocking UI

### 📝 Documentation

- Added comprehensive performance analysis documentation
- Created detailed implementation guides for drag & drop optimization
- Added quick testing guides for developers
